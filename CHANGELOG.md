## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-16

### Added — HD multisig (v1.1.0 foundations)
- **Step 3: address-index browser on `MultisigShowAddress`.** Users can navigate between the infinite series of HD multisig addresses produced by the shared cosigner xpubs. Bottom nav row with `[<]` `[#N]` `[>]` buttons mirrors the singlesig receive-address UX; the center `[#N]` button opens the existing numeric-keypad `AddrIndexPicker` (reused via a sentinel `ms_picking_key=255` so GO writes back into `ms_creating.addr_index` instead of the singlesig `current_addr_index`). Each navigation action calls `build_script()` which re-derives every cosigner's child at the new index, lex-sorts, emits a fresh script, and the redraw computes the new P2SH from the blake2b of that script. Addresses stay shared across cosigner devices — both devices browse in lockstep as long as they both land on the same index. Current index is mirrored into the matching `ms_store.configs[]` entry so leaving and re-entering the wallet returns to the last-viewed index (RAM-only; persists across navigations, not across reboots — stateless-by-design).

### Fixed — Multisig SD workflow
- **Two devices produced different multisig P2SH addresses even with "same pubkeys in same order"** (TODO 7). Root cause: when the device added ITS OWN key to a new multisig via the "Use Loaded Seed" flow, `handlers/tx.rs` stored the **address-level** x-only pubkey (`pubkey_cache[current_addr_index]` = m/44'/111111'/0'/0/N). Meanwhile, the OTHER cosigner's kpub imported via QR/SD went through `import_kpub()` which returns the **account-level** x-only pubkey (m/44'/111111'/0'). Two different 32-byte keys from the same seed → different lexicographic sort order in `build_script()` → different script bytes → different blake2b hash → different P2SH address on each device. Fix: own-key SELECT now derives the account-level x-only pubkey from the cached `acct_key_raw`, matching what `import_kpub()` produces. Both devices now supply account-level pubkeys; after sort, both produce byte-identical scripts → identical P2SH address. Signing path already accepts account-level pubkeys (existing `account_key.x_only()` fallback in `sign_transaction_multisig` from v1.0.2) so no signing regression. Note: the address-index picker UI on `MultisigPickAddr` is now informational — the browse/select actions still work but `current_addr_index` no longer affects the stored pubkey (it's always account-level). UI simplification deferred to a later polish pass.
- **Red trash button on multisig SD file list was unresponsive.** The `SdKpubFileList` touch handler (used by Multisig Address, Multisig Descriptor, and kpub import file pickers) routed every tap on a file row — including the red trash icon area — to "load this file". Mirrored the existing `SdFileList` pattern: right ~40px of each card (`x > 236`) now triggers a delete intent. Added a new `sd_delete_return: AppState` field on `AppData` so `SdDeleteConfirm` can bounce back to the correct list after confirm or cancel (falls back to filename-extension sniffing for the legacy seed-backup/KSPT callers, so those continue to work unchanged).
- **M5Stack: multi-frame QR scan progress dots invisible.** The dots render at `y=226..240`; the M5 camera viewfinder was sized `vf_h=192` starting at `vf_y=44`, extending to `y=236` — directly over the dots. Shrunk M5 `vf_h` from 192 to 180 (matching Waveshare) so the dot strip is preserved. Viewfinder still occupies the full chrome-adjusted region; no visible size change on the already-centered 240-wide preview.

### Fixed — Multisig SD workflow
- **Passphrase entry keyboards full-screen flashed on every keypress** — root cause: three handlers (`SdRestorePassphrase`, `SdXprvExportPassphrase`, `SdXprvImportPassphrase`) were missing the `1 =>` match arm that calls `draw_keyboard_screen` for valid character entry. Typed chars fell through to `_ => {}` → trailing `needs_redraw = true;` → full-screen redraw (header + keyboard layout + input strip). Fixed by adding the arm, adding partial redraws on backspace/space, and scoping `needs_redraw = true` to page change / OK / back only.
- **Keyboard per-keypress flash reduced** across all keyboard input screens via opaque-glyph rendering. Added `draw_prop_text_opaque()` in `ui/prop_fonts.rs` — glyphs render with opaque background via one `fill_contiguous` SPI burst per glyph (BG + FG pixels in a single transaction). No pre-clear of the text strip needed; unchanged glyphs transition same-to-same (invisible). Keyboards using this path (SD filename keyboards, password, stego description/hint, seed-word import) also feel more responsive.
  - Added `draw_lato_22_opaque()` wrappers in both `hw/display_ws.rs` and `hw/display_m5.rs`.
  - `draw_keyboard_screen` and `draw_import_keyboard` in `ui/screens.rs` rewritten to use opaque paint + narrow tail clear only. Same visual fidelity (fonts, colors, layout, cursor all preserved).
- **Password keyboard `needs_redraw` cleanup** (SdKsptEncryptPass): removed trailing unconditional `needs_redraw = true;` that was overriding the partial-redraw pattern. Matches the pattern used in address/descriptor filename keyboards.
- **Multisig address/descriptor filename keyboard blink fix**. The trailing `needs_redraw = true;` at the end of the `SdMsAddrFilename` and `SdMsDescFilename` handlers unconditionally overwrote the `needs_redraw = false` set by char-entry and backspace arms, forcing a full redraw (→ visible BG flash) on every keypress instead of the partial input-strip redraw. Moved `needs_redraw = true` to only fire on page change, OK, and back-press. Miss-tap no longer triggers a wasteful redraw either.
- **Multisig address loaded from SD** no longer routes through the signed-TX pipeline. Dedicated `MultisigShowAddressQR` dual-path renders the loaded address with the correct "MULTISIG QR" title; tap returns to main menu (no bogus "SIGNED TX" popup, no wrong TX/KSP filename, no multi-frame mode choice for single-frame data).
- **Multisig descriptor loaded from SD** now parses the `multi(M,hex1,hex2,...)` text and populates `ms_creating` (view-only, `.active=false`), then routes to the existing `MultisigDescriptor` screen — same participant-summary view as the live flow. Back button in that state branches on `ms_creating.active` so the SD-loaded flow returns to main menu.
- **CRITICAL: buffer overflow panic** on loading a 2-of-2+ descriptor from SD. Root cause: the descriptor bytes (up to 400) were being copied into `kpub_data` (120 bytes), causing `range end index 204 out of range for slice of length 120` and forcing a reboot. Fixed by parsing directly from the read buffer — no intermediate copy into the undersized `kpub_data`. Same defensive clamp added to the address load path.
- **Descriptor save flow** now follows the same keyboard+encrypt+overwrite pattern as KSPT and multisig address saves. New `SdMsDescFilename` and `SdMsDescEncryptAsk` states. Auto-generated filename uses `MD` prefix (e.g., `MD000001.TXT`). Descriptor text is staged into `signed_qr_buf` (1024 bytes) instead of `kpub_data` to handle large N-of-M configurations. Encrypt path reuses `SdKsptEncryptPass` with `sd_txt_origin=2`. No more hardcoded `MSDESC.TXT` overwrite.
- **Loading label** on SD file tap is now contextual: "Reading kpub...", "Reading address...", "Reading descriptor..." based on `txt_import_type` (no more misleading "Reading kpub..." for descriptors).
- **Descriptor load error bailout**: parse failure or invalid file size now returns to main menu after the error screen (prevents re-tapping the same bad file on the list).
- New helper: `parse_descriptor()` in `handlers/sd.rs` — validates prefix/suffix, single-digit M, exactly 64 hex chars per pubkey, comma separators, max keys per `MAX_MULTISIG_KEYS`.

### Changed

- `kassee/Cargo.toml` version bumped to 1.0.3

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-13

### Added — Device Firmware
- **cam_dma camera pipeline** — new DMA-based 480×480 YUV422 capture for Waveshare, replacing DvpCamera. Direct SYSTIMER register reads for QR decode performance timing.
- **OV2640 runtime auto-detect** — Waveshare now probes sensor ID at boot; OV2640 wide-angle supported alongside OV5640 (`camera_ov2640.rs`, `cam_dma.rs`)
- **kpub multi-frame QR export** — choose 2/3/4 frames, auto-cycle or manual navigation, save to SD, import from SD. New states: `ExportKpubFrameCount`, `ExportKpubModeChoice`, `ExportKpubPopup`, `KpubScannedPopup`, `SdKpubFileList`, `SdKpubFilename`
- **Signed QR frame size choice** — `ShowQrFrameChoice` lets user pick single vs multi-frame signed KSPT export
- **Multisig address SD save** — `MultisigSaveAddrAsk` state with optional encryption
- **SD overwrite confirmation** — generic `sd_overwrite_next`/`sd_overwrite_back` state machine prompts before overwriting existing files
- **SD file helpers** — extracted `sd_file_exists()`, `build_filename_83()`, `write_file_to_sd()`, `generate_trng_nonce()` as reusable functions
- **Multi-frame QR buffers expanded** — `MF_BUF` 2KB→5KB, `MF_RECEIVED`/`MF_FRAG_SIZE` 8→20 slots for larger KSPT payloads
- **Account-level PSKT signing fallback** — when address-level key doesn't match, tries account xonly pubkey (`acct.public_key_x_only()`)

### Fixed — Device Firmware
- **CST816D touch sensitivity** — threshold 0x28→0x50, low-power scan 0x10→0x20, auto-sleep disabled. Fixes ghost touches on Waveshare.

### Code Quality
- **Clippy cleanup** — zero warnings on `clippy::all` for both bootloader and KasSee WASM
- Inlined 38 format args, removed 9 unnecessary casts, added digit separators
- Eliminated 3× `Vec::clone()` in UTXO selection (sort in place, consume by value)
- QR SVG generation: `write!()` instead of `&format!()` — zero allocation per module
- `ws_rpc_call`: `.take()` instead of `.clone()` on WebSocket result
- `funded_addresses`: counts unique script_public_keys by reference
- Removed 7 redundant `#[allow(dead_code)]` directives
- 36 well-documented pedantic-tier `#[allow]` directives in `main.rs` for embedded patterns
- Removed dead code: `key_rect()` in pin_ui, `_word_idx` in sdcard_ws
- Removed orphaned zero-width text steganography code from `features/stego.rs` (unused constants, templates, `decode_stego_text()`, `contains_stego()`) — JPEG EXIF stego uses base64, not ZW characters

### KasSee Web
- **Donate card** — rebuilt with fully inline styles, no CSS conflicts with app screens
- **Broadcast → Donate flow** — after successful TX, user sees donate card before dashboard
- **UTXO selection fix** — sort in place + consume by value; sweep now takes top 5 UTXOs by size

### QR Decoder
- **rqrr no_std fork** — replaced custom per-platform decoders (`decoder_ws.rs`, `decoder_m5.rs`) with `rqrr_nostd`, a no_std zero-dependency fork of rqrr 0.10.1
- Supports V1–V40, all ECC levels, full Reed-Solomon error correction
- Single-pass accept — rqrr's RS verification replaces the old 5-pass voting (Waveshare) and 3-consecutive match (M5Stack) heuristics
- Unified `rqrr_decode()` in `camera_loop.rs` for both platforms
- Deleted `bootloader/src/qr/decoder_ws.rs` and `bootloader/src/qr/decoder_m5.rs`

### Infrastructure
- Bootloader `Cargo.toml` version bumped to 1.0.2
- Docker build tags updated to v1.0.2
- **Version cleanup** — removed hardcoded version strings from filenames, titles, and docs; splash screen now reads version dynamically from `CURRENT_VERSION`
